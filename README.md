# Mein Wortschatz App
This is a repository for learning German vocabulary.

Motivation:

The app was created to address the limitations of traditional language learning tools, such as dictionaries that provide overwhelming amounts of information, making it difficult for learners to retain vocabulary. By offering a simpler, more focused learning experience, the app aims to help users effectively acquire and remember new vocabulary, while allowing them to easily revisit and review previously learned words.

Core Features:

1.	Simplified Learning: Concise word definitions without excessive details.
2.	Word Review: Easy access to previously searched words for reinforcement.
3.	Contextual Learning: New words are linked with learned vocabulary in definitions and sentence examples.
4.	GPT Integration: Utilizes GPT API to generate dynamic and relevant examples.
